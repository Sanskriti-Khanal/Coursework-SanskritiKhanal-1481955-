# 🏡 Yorkshire Residential Recommendation System

This project builds a data-driven **district recommendation system** for **South and West Yorkshire**, UK. It integrates real-world datasets—covering **house prices, broadband speeds, crime rates, and school performance**—to help users make informed decisions when choosing places to live.

## 📌 Project Overview

Using the **Data Mining Lifecycle**, the project progresses through:
- Data Acquisition
- Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Linear Modelling
- Scoring & Recommendation

Each district receives a score (0–10) per factor, combined into an overall recommendation score. The top districts are visualized and ranked based on these results.

## 🔍 Key Datasets

- 🏠 **House Prices** (UK Price Paid Data)
- ⚡ **Broadband Speeds** (Ofcom)
- 🚓 **Crime Rates** (UK Police Data)
- 🎓 **School Attainment (Attainment 8)** (Department for Education)
- 👥 **Population Data** (ONS)

All datasets are sourced from **public government repositories** and processed using **R** and the `tidyverse` ecosystem.
